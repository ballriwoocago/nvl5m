Jesssoweird has collaborated with various artists, including mxmtoon, Chelsea Cutler, and Claud. These collaborations have further showcased her versatility and willingness to explore different musical styles. Her latest project, "Ashes," is a testament to her artistic growth, showcasing a more mature and introspective side of her songwriting.
